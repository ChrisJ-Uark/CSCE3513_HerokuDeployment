# Heroku Deployment Program

## What is this?
This repository is dedicated to a backup of the program deployed to Heroku to display database information for CSCE3513_TeamProject.
This repository was not pushed from GitHub to Heroku. Instead, the git repository used is on a local computer. It should otherwise be an exact copy of the program thus far.

## Should I install this? What do I need this for?
This repository has no other purpose than being a backup repository in case the copy on the local computer is somehow damaged or deleted. This is also uploaded here for the graders and fellow team members of Team 8 to view. Installing this will not run on your machine without developer access to the Heroku app, and this is currently only intended for the test repository that can be viewed here: https://helloherokux4124.herokuapp.com/. 

In the future, this README may be updated with steps on how to set the database url to access the Heroku database and push to Heroku from a local computer.
